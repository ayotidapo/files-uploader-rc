   const [chosenFiles, setChosenFiles] = React.useState([])

   const maxNumOfFiles='max-number-of-files-you-want-to-allow-for-upload'

  const [uploading, completed, onRemoveFile, files, responseUrls] = useRcfUploader(uri, chosenFiles,maxNumOfFiles)

   console.log(responseUrls)


   // maxNumOfFiles is 5 by default but can be changed.
   // responseUrls is an array of all the urls of the uploaded files
   // uploading indicates uploading is still ongoing this can be used to know when to enable the submit  button
   // completed is when no ongoing uploads

}
```
